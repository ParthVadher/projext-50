<h3>CAMEL</h3>
</center>
<p>



    There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels.
<br>
    Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes. 
<br>
    Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can't eat.

<h3>CHAMELEON</h3>  
</center>
<p>
    Chameleons have amazing eyes. The bulging upper and lower eyelids are joined and the pupil peaks out from a pinhole sized gap.
    <br>
     The chameleons' eyes can rotate and focus separately on 180-degree arcs, so they can see two different objects at the same time. 
     <br>
     This gives them a full 360-degree field of vision.

<h3>PANDA</h3>    
</center>
    <p>
    “Giant panda” is actually just a nickname for a panda; 
    <br>
    They are no specifically larger than others. Pandas eat consistently for 12-14 hours a day!
    <br>
     Adult panda bears can weigh as much as 45 kilos (100 pounds). Like other bears, pandas can swim!

<h3>TEDDY BEAR</h3>
    </center>
<p>
    One of the world's most beloved toys was named in honor of President Theodore Roosevelt,
    <br>
     after he refused to shoot a bear during a Mississippi hunting trip in November 1902.

     <br> During the trip, guides clubbed a bear and tied it to a tree then invited the president to shoot it

<h3>CICADA</h3>
    </center>
<p>
    Cicadas are mostly beneficial.
    <br> They prune mature trees, aerate the soil, and once they die, their bodies serve as an important source of nitrogen for growing trees.

<h3>PIGEON</h3>
</center>
<p>
    They are one of only a small number of species to pass the 'mirror test' – a test of self recognition. 
    <br> Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.
    <br> Pigeons mate for life, and tend to raise two chicks at the same time
